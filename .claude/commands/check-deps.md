description: Check and suggest relevant Rust dependencies
---

Review the current dependencies in Cargo.toml and suggest relevant crates for HAR file processing, including:
- JSON parsing (serde, serde_json)
- CLI framework (clap)
- Error handling (anyhow, thiserror)
- HTTP client libraries if needed
- Any other useful utilities

Consider binary size, maintenance status, and popularity when making recommendations.
